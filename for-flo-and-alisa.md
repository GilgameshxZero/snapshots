Thank you so much for hosting me! I had forgotten how much I missed the bay, you two, and the rest of the lounge since you all graduated, but I can’t help but look back on those days fondly, wishing I could relive it for just a weekend. But I suppose these things do come to an end, and so too do our relationships change, for us to see each other every couple of years instead of days. Perhaps some of that is my fault as well, for causing so much drama, as much as you claim to like it. In any case, please do keep me in mind and watch me as I devour the world, and don’t hesitate to reach out if I can ever help.
